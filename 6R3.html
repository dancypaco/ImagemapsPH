      <h2>Region III - Central Luzon</h2>
      <h3>Verdivia Falls</h3>
      <br>
      <p>Central Luzon, officially designated as Region III, is an administrative region in the Philippines occupying the central section of Luzon. It covers 7 provinces, namely, Aurora, Bataan, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, Tarlac, and Zambales, as well as 2 highly urbanized cities. The regional center is the City of San Fernando.</p>
      <p>The Verdivia Falls is located in Brgy. Talbak, Do√±a Remedios Trinidad, Bulacan. <br>
         This 15-foot waterfall fills a very wide pool of water in its basin, which is perfect for friends and families. The heat can grow intense in Bulacan, so taking a dip in Verdivia will refresh every visitor.
